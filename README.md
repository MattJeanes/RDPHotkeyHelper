# RDPHotkeyHelper
RDPHotkeyHelper is an AutoHotkey v2 script which redirects media keys to the local machine while working within a remote desktop session. It works with Microsoft's standard remote desktop connection, the Microsoft store app, as well as the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection.  
Using media keys on the remote host is still possible by holding down `Ctrl`, `Shift` or `Alt` when pressing the media key.  
If you want to use different hotkeys as media keys, please refer to https://github.com/neon-dev/RDPHotkeyHelper/issues/10#issuecomment-2255789905.
